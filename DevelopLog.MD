1. Export point clouds data to be *.pts: Uploaded on [Google Drive]().
2. Paper research: [Position Based Fluid, 2012 Nvidia](http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf) Will implement this for fluid.

Note:

  1. The exported *.pts file takes 8Gb, which is infeasible to load. Need to start with smaller model
  2. Need to study on how to deal with collision.
