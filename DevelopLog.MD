1. Export point clouds data to be *.pts: Uploaded on [Google Drive]().
   

2. Paper research: [Position Based Fluid, 2012 Nvidia](http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf) Will implement this for fluid.

Note:

  1. The exported *.pts file takes 8Gb, which is infeasible to load. Need to start with smaller model
   
  2. Need to study on how to deal with collision. 
   
  3. Implement the mass spring simulation next week
