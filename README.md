There are many tools for high quality rendering for architectural visualization like _V-Ray for 3ds Max_, _KeyShot_, etc. Most of them are not free, and cause significant time to render one frame. This is not hard to understand because they are aiming at producing physically realistic images. Thus we are hoping to implement an application for real-time rendering with support for simple lighting transportation, nature phenomenon simulation. Virtual reality devices (like VR) would also be supported to create an immersive, interactive experience.

For example, given a 3-D model we would like to simulate physical motion of the plants effected by the wind; the motion of the static water pond; the snow/rain falling on the roof. On the other hand, we are also interested in the real-time rendering capacity to mimic environmental elements like sky, mist, sun (dawn/noon/night) and so forth.

In summary, we are going to implement a real-time(hopefully) visualization tool for architecture design. The application would feature **realistic lighting** and **nature phenomenon simulation**. We also plan to integrate it with Oculus SDK for **immersive virtual reality experience**. Within the constellation of reality computing applications, this project stands in the 'compute' part. We hope it could be used to facilitate the process of architectural design realization.
